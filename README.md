# tonight.nvim ðŸŒ™

Tonight is a dark colour scheme for [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) written in Lua and based on [Tomorrow Dark](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-tomorrow-scheme) and [Spacegray](https://github.com/ackyshake/Spacegray.vim).

## Why?

I made it because the aforementioned colour schemes are great but quite dim and unappealing to look at over long periods of time. The main idea is to look at a colour and know instantly what it is *every single time* without the mental overhead of staring at it too long. This, for me, does that.
